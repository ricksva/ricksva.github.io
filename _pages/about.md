I'm a Teaching Professor of Philosophy and Computer Science in the College of Social Sciences
and Humanities (CSSH) and in Khoury College of Computing Sciences, at Northeastern University.
I think and write about the philosophical implications of digital technologies, among other topics.
I teach undergraduate- and graduate-level philosophy courses mostly focused on the, and I work
with other Philosophy and CS faculty to incorporate the teaching of ethical concepts into the Computer
Science curriculum. We make heavy use of the Value Sensitive Design and Values Analysis in Design
frameworks and approaches.

Other organizations that I consult(ed) with on these topic areas include the Boston Public Schools
system, ByteDance Corporation, Meta Corporation, and the State of Colorado's Attorney General's office.

My undergraduate and doctoral degrees are in Philosophy, and my focus in graduate school was on friendship and theory of
action. During and after college, and before graduate school, I was a technical writer and computer programmer at IBM.

I also have a variety of tremendously fascinating pastimes and interests.
