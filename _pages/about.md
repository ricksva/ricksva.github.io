I'm a Teaching Professor of Philosophy and Computer Science in the College of Social Sciences and Humanities (CSSH) and in Khoury College of Computing Sciences, at Northeastern University. I teach philosophy courses and I work with other Khoury
faculty to incorporate theteaching of ethical concepts into the Computer Science curriculum.

My undergraduate and doctoral degrees are in Philosophy, and my focus in graduate school was on friendship and theory of
action. During and after college, and before graduate school, I was a technical writer and computer programmer at IBM.
I think and write about the ethical implications of digital technologies, among other topics. I also have a variety of
tremendously fascinating pastimes and interests.
